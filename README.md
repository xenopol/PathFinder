#PathFinder
Android application for sending your location to a friend 

##Problem definition
  Whenever you are meeting a friend in the city you have to give him/her a meeting point. Every once in a while it happens that either you or him are not familiar with the meeting point so it might get a bit hard to find each other. There are alternatives like meeting at a landmark or sending a meeting point via Google Maps but none of them is an “out of the box solution”. They require several small steps.
  
##Problem formulation
  How can we provide an out of the box solution for friends or group of friends that want to meet with each other?
  How can we make this solution more appealing, what features can we add?

##Solution specification - Concept introduction
  Path Finder is an app that helps you locate your friends. It will have a simple button (“Send location”) that will allow the user to send his Google Maps location to any friend by SMS, Facebook or any other available method.
